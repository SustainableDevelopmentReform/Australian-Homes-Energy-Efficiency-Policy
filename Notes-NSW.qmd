# Notes: NSW

### Policies

NSW Government policies provide frameworks for energy efficiency in the residential housing sector, setting targets, defining standards, and guiding program development.

#### NSW Energy Efficiency Action Plan

The NSW Energy Efficiency Action Plan[^notes-nsw-1] focuses on reducing household energy use and improving business energy productivity. The plan sets targets for annual energy savings of 16,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020 and aims to support 220,000 low-income households in reducing energy consumption.

#### NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)

The NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)[^notes-nsw-2] addresses government operating costs and resource efficiency through measures in energy, water, waste, and air emissions. Key energy measures include:

#### Australian Energy Efficiency Policy Handbook

The Australian Energy Efficiency Policy Handbook[^notes-nsw-3] outlines energy efficiency policies in Australia. It addresses energy retailer obligations, climate change policy alignment, and energy market policy coordination. The handbook discusses national residential energy efficiency disclosure schemes, rental property standards, and public housing upgrade programs.

#### Building Sustainability Index (BASIX)

The Building Sustainability Index (BASIX)[^notes-nsw-5] sets minimum requirements for energy efficiency, water efficiency, and thermal comfort in new homes and renovations. BASIX supplements the National Construction Code (NCC) by providing a framework for sustainable building practices in NSW. The index evaluates climate zone, building design, and material selection factors to address environmental impact.
