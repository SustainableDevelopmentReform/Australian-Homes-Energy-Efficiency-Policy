    "### Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "NSW Government policies provide frameworks for energy efficiency in the residential housing sector, setting targets, defining standards, and guiding program development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NSW Energy Efficiency Action Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSW Energy Efficiency Action Plan[1] focuses on reducing household energy use and improving business energy productivity. The plan sets targets for annual energy savings of 16,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020 and aims to support 220,000 low-income households in reducing energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)[2] addresses government operating costs and resource efficiency through measures in energy, water, waste, and air emissions. Key energy measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Energy savings targets across government sites\n",
    "-   Minimum National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) Energy ratings for offices and data centers\n",
    "-   Standards for new electrical appliances and equipment\n",
    "-   Standards for new buildings and fit-outs\n",

    "-   Fuel efficiency standards for new light vehicles\n",
    "-   6% GreenPower purchase requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Australian Energy Efficiency Policy Handbook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Australian Energy Efficiency Policy Handbook[3] outlines energy efficiency policies in Australia. It addresses energy retailer obligations, climate change policy alignment, and energy market policy coordination. The handbook discusses national residential energy efficiency disclosure schemes, rental property standards, and public housing upgrade programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "NSW Government regulations set standards for energy performance in residential housing. These regulations establish requirements for new and existing homes[4].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building Sustainability Index (BASIX)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Building Sustainability Index (BASIX)[5] sets minimum requirements for energy efficiency, water efficiency, and thermal comfort in new homes and renovations. BASIX supplements the National Construction Code (NCC) by providing a framework for sustainable building practices in NSW. The index evaluates climate zone, building design, and material selection factors to address environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Home Energy Efficiency Retrofits - Measurement of Energy Savings (HEER) Method Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The HEER Method Guide[6] provides methodology for measuring energy savings from residential building retrofits. It specifies requirements for calculating and verifying energy savings and defines roles for Accredited Certificate Providers (ACPs) and purchasers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Home Energy Ratings Disclosure Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Energy Ratings Disclosure Framework[7] aims to standardize energy efficiency information disclosure for residential buildings. The framework coordinates with existing disclosure schemes and promotes consistency across jurisdictions. It focuses on providing clear energy performance information to inform consumer decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "NSW Government schemes provide financial incentives and support for residential energy efficiency upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Energy Savings Scheme (ESS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Energy Savings Scheme (ESS)[8] creates financial incentives for energy savings activities through a market for energy savings certificates (ESCs). Electricity retailers must acquire specified numbers of ESCs annually. The scheme continues until a comparable national scheme is introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NSW Consumer Energy Strategy 2024\n",
