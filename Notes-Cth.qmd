# Notes: Cth

This report draws on authoritative government publications and reports to provide a comprehensive overview of energy efficiency policies, regulations, schemes, and other measures relevant to residential housing in Australia at the Commonwealth (federal) level.

## **Energy Efficiency Policies**

Australia has demonstrated a commitment to improving energy efficiency, setting a national target of 40% improvement in energy productivity by 2030[^notes-cth-1]. This target is linked to broader climate and energy security goals, as energy efficiency measures can contribute to a more resilient energy system[^notes-cth-2]. While the country has made progress in energy savings since 2000 in the industrial and services sectors, primarily through efficiency disclosure regimes, labeling, and the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (GEMS) for appliances, improvement rates have slowed in recent years[^notes-cth-3]. To achieve its ambitious target and contribute to net-zero emissions, Australia needs to accelerate its efforts and double annual improvement rates from their recent drag[^notes-cth-4].

The Australian Government is pursuing its energy and emissions reduction agenda through various initiatives, including:

-   **The Energy and Climate Ministerial Council:** This council facilitates collaboration between the Australian Government and state and territory governments on energy and climate policy[^notes-cth-5].
-   **The National Energy Transformation Partnership:** This partnership provides a framework for cooperation between different levels of government to transform Australia's energy system and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050[^notes-cth-6].
-   **Powering Australia:** This plan focuses on job creation, reducing energy bills, and lowering emissions by promoting renewable energy. It includes commitments to national climate leadership, energy sector transformation, industrial and agricultural decarbonization, and transport sector improvements[^notes-cth-7].

## **Energy Efficiency Regulations**

### **National Construction Code (NCC)**

The NCC sets minimum energy efficiency requirements for new homes to ensure they are sustainable, safe, and comfortable. In 2022, Building Ministers agreed to raise the minimum thermal energy rating for new homes, resulting in updated requirements in NCC 2022[^notes-cth-8]. These updates include:

[^notes-cth-8]: Residential buildings - DCCEEW, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/energy-efficiency/buildings/residential-buildings>

-   **Increased Star Ratings:** New homes must now achieve the equivalent of 7 stars (out of 10) for NatHERS thermal performance[^notes-cth-9].
-   **Whole of Home Rating:** This new assessment predicts the annual energy use of a home, including heating, cooling, and on-site energy generation and storage. New houses must achieve a rating of 60 (out of 100), while new units must achieve 50 (out of 100)[^notes-cth-10].

[^notes-cth-9]: Residential buildings - DCCEEW, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/energy-efficiency/buildings/residential-buildings>

[^notes-cth-10]: Residential buildings - DCCEEW, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/energy-efficiency/buildings/residential-buildings>

These changes are estimated to save an average of \$183 per year on energy bills for new homes[^notes-cth-11]. States and territories are adopting these requirements at various times.

### **Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (GEMS) Act**

The GEMS Act 2012 provides a national framework for appliance and equipment energy efficiency[^notes-cth-12]. It promotes the development and adoption of energy-efficient appliances and equipment to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The GEMS Act includes:

[^notes-cth-12]: Legislative framework \| Energy Rating, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://www.energyrating.gov.au/industry-information/understand-requirements/legislative-framework>

-   **Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS):** These standards specify the minimum level of energy performance that appliances and equipment must meet or exceed before they can be supplied or used for commercial purposes in Australia. MEPS are an effective way to increase the energy efficiency of products, ensuring they use less energy and have lower running costs over their lifetime[^notes-cth-13].
-   **Energy Rating Label:** This label allows consumers to compare the energy efficiency and running costs of appliances[^notes-cth-14].

## **Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS)**

NatHERS is a critical component of Australia's energy efficiency efforts in the residential sector. It provides a star rating (out of 10) based on the thermal performance of a home, indicating how much heating and cooling it will require[^notes-cth-15]. Key aspects of NatHERS include:

[^notes-cth-15]: Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://www.certifiedenergy.com.au/esd/nathers-certificate/nationwide-house-energy-rating-scheme>

-   **NCC 2022 Integration:** NatHERS is used to demonstrate compliance with the updated energy efficiency requirements in NCC 2022. New houses must achieve a minimum 7-star rating and a Whole of Home rating of 60[^notes-cth-16].
-   **Assessment Tools:** NatHERS-accredited software tools are used to assess the energy efficiency of homes based on their design, construction, and location[^notes-cth-17].
-   **Expansion to Existing Homes:** Expanding NatHERS to provide energy ratings for existing homes is a crucial step towards widespread energy efficiency improvements in the existing housing stock. These ratings will help homeowners understand their home's energy performance and make informed decisions about upgrades, potentially unlocking access to "green loans" with lower interest rates[^notes-cth-18].

## **Energy Efficiency Schemes**

While Australia does not have a national energy savings scheme, several schemes operate at the state and territory level, and the Commonwealth Government plays a role through national initiatives and funding programs[^notes-cth-19]:

[^notes-cth-19]: National - Energy Savings Industry Association \| ESIA, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://esia.asn.au/schemes/national>

-   **Household Energy Upgrades Fund:** In the 2023-24 Budget, the Australian Government allocated \$1.3 billion to establish this fund[^notes-cth-20]. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will manage \$1 billion to partner with lenders and offer low-cost finance for energy performance upgrades in over 110,000 homes. Loans will be available to upgrade homes with battery-ready solar PV, modern energy-efficient appliances, and other improvements, creating more comfortable homes that waste less energy[^notes-cth-21].

-   **Energy Savings Scheme (ESS) in New South Wales:** This state-level scheme aims to deliver cost-effective energy savings for NSW households and businesses by providing financial incentives to install energy-efficient equipment and appliances[^notes-cth-22].

-   **Investment in Energy-Saving Upgrades:** In the 2023-24 Budget, the Australian Government invested \$1.6 billion for energy-saving upgrades to social housing, homes, and businesses. This significant investment underscores the government's commitment to improving energy efficiency across the residential sector[^notes-cth-23].
