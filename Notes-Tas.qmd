## **Energy Efficiency Policies in Tasmania**

Tasmania faces a unique challenge: despite having relatively low electricity prices, Tasmanians experience high energy bills due to several factors, including the cool climate, older housing stock with poor thermal efficiency, and a reliance on inefficient electric appliances for heating[^notes-tas-1]. This paradox highlights the critical need for robust energy efficiency policies in the state.

To address this challenge, Tasmania has implemented several policies aimed at improving energy efficiency in residential housing. These policies are driven by the need to reduce energy consumption, lower household energy bills, and mitigate the impact of climate change.

One of the key policies is the **Tasmanian Renewable Energy Target**, which aims to increase the state's renewable energy output by 200% based on 2022 figures by 2040[^notes-tas-2]. This target is supported by the **Tasmanian Renewable Energy Action Plan**, which outlines the government's vision and actions for achieving this goal[^notes-tas-3].

Recognizing the need to improve the energy efficiency of existing homes, the state government has committed \$15 million in the 2020/2021 Tasmanian Budget for public housing heating and energy efficiency initiatives[^notes-tas-4]. This initiative aims to improve living conditions for public housing tenants while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions[^notes-tas-5].

Furthermore, the government acknowledges the disparity in energy efficiency ratings between homeowners and tenants, particularly those who are financially vulnerable[^notes-tas-6]. Policy measures are being explored to address this disparity and ensure equitable access to energy-efficient housing for all Tasmanians.

The potential for energy efficiency policies to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions is also recognized. Studies indicate that implementing these policies could reduce emissions by 40.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2-e) by 2050[^notes-tas-7].

## **Energy Efficiency Regulations in Tasmania**

Tasmania has adopted regulations to ensure that new homes and renovations meet energy efficiency standards. These regulations are primarily based on the National Construction Code (NCC) and the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS).

It is important to note that the average energy efficiency rating of existing homes in Australia is only 1.7 stars, while in Tasmania, it is 4 stars[^notes-tas-8]. This highlights the need for continuous improvement in the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock.

Since 2003, Tasmania has required mandatory energy efficiency measures for new housing[^notes-tas-9]. In 2009, a "5 Star" requirement under NatHERS was introduced, and this was further increased to a "6-Star" standard in 2013[^notes-tas-10]. This 6-star standard plays a crucial role in driving the construction of energy-efficient homes in Tasmania[^notes-tas-11].
