## **Energy Efficiency Policies and Regulations**

The ACT Government is committed to improving energy efficiency in the residential sector to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This commitment is reflected in various policies and regulations, with key initiatives including:

-   **Building Codes:** The ACT has implemented building codes that mandate minimum energy performance standards for new residential buildings. These codes ensure that new homes are built with energy-efficient features, such as insulation, double glazing, and energy-efficient appliances. For example, new homes may be required to have a minimum level of insulation in walls and ceilings, and windows must meet certain energy efficiency standards[^notes-act-6].
-   **Energy Efficiency Certification:** The ACT Government requires energy efficiency certification for residential buildings. This certification provides information about a building's energy performance, using a standardized rating system, and helps buyers and renters make informed decisions[^notes-act-7].
-   **Appliance Standards and Labelling:** The ACT has adopted energy efficiency standards and labelling for household appliances. This helps consumers identify and choose appliances that consume less energy by providing a clear and comparable energy efficiency rating on appliances[^notes-act-8].

## **Electrification of Canberra**

The ACT Government is preparing to electrify the city and transition away from fossil fuel gas by 2045[^notes-act-9]. This initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a cleaner energy future for Canberra. The government plans to achieve this transition by phasing out gas connections in new suburbs and providing incentives for households to switch to electric appliances and heating systems. The benefits of an all-electric Canberra include reduced reliance on fossil fuels, improved air quality, and lower energy costs for households.

## **Energy Efficiency Schemes and Programs**

The ACT Government offers a range of schemes and programs to support households in improving the energy efficiency of their homes and to assist those facing housing stress:

-   **Home Energy Efficiency Program:** This free program provides advice and support to renters and homeowners on how to save money on energy bills while maintaining comfort. The program offers information kits with energy-saving tips, draught-proofing assistance, and in-home energy assessments to help households identify and implement energy-saving measures[^notes-act-10].
-   **Sustainable Household Scheme:** This scheme provides interest-free loans to eligible households for energy-efficient upgrades, such as solar panels, battery storage, and efficient heating and cooling systems[^notes-act-11].
-   **Utilities Concession Scheme:** This scheme offers discounts on electricity, natural gas, water, and sewerage bills to eligible households, including pensioners and low-income health care card holders[^notes-act-12].
-   **Supportive Tenancy Service:** This service provides support to tenants who are in housing stress or at risk of homelessness. The service advocates for tenants with landlords and lenders, refers tenants to support services, and provides support at ACAT hearings. This service is available to all households, including public and private tenants and homeowners[^notes-act-13].

## **Research and Reports**

Several research papers and reports have examined energy efficiency in residential housing in the ACT and beyond. These studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different policies and programs, as well as the challenges and opportunities for further improvement.

One key area of research focuses on identifying effective Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs) that can reduce energy consumption in homes. Studies have shown that measures such as insulation, heating and cooling upgrades, and efficient lighting can significantly reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions[^notes-act-24].

[^notes-act-24]: "Residential energy efficiency interventions: A meta‚Äêanalysis of effectiveness studies," PMC, accessed January 8, 2025, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8988770/

Research has also explored the factors that influence the adoption of energy efficiency measures in households. Studies have identified barriers such as financial constraints, lack of awareness, and perceived complexity of upgrades[^notes-act-25]. Understanding these barriers and drivers is crucial for designing effective policies and programs that encourage energy efficiency upgrades.

Another important area of research examines the impact of energy efficiency on rental properties. Studies have shown that energy-efficient features in rental properties can lead to higher rental prices, suggesting a positive economic impact for property owners[^notes-act-26].

[^notes-act-26]: "Energy efficiency in U.S. residential rental housing: Adoption rates and impact on rent," ResearchGate, accessed January 8, 2025, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319345804_Energy_efficiency_in_US_residential_rental_housing_Adoption_rates_and_impact_on_rent

Furthermore, research has highlighted the connection between energy efficiency and sustainable development goals[^notes-act-27]. Improving energy efficiency in residential housing contributes to broader sustainability goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting resource conservation.

## **Industry Perspectives**

Industry reports and white papers provide further insights into energy efficiency in residential housing in the ACT. One concern raised by industry reports is the potential impact of stricter energy efficiency standards on housing affordability[^notes-act-28]. While acknowledging the benefits of energy efficiency, some stakeholders argue that stricter standards could increase construction costs and make housing less affordable, particularly for first-time buyers and low-income households.

[^notes-act-28]: "New Energy Codes Mandate a Blow to Housing Affordability," NAHB, accessed January 8, 2025, https://www.nahb.org/blog/2024/04/new-energy-codes-mandate-blow-to-housing-affordability

Industry stakeholders also emphasize the importance of market transformation strategies to encourage the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices[^notes-act-29]. Another key perspective from industry reports is the need for innovative financing mechanisms to support homeowners in making energy efficiency upgrades[^notes-act-30].

Furthermore, industry reports highlight the importance of considering the long-term cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency measures[^notes-act-31]. This includes evaluating the payback periods for different upgrades and considering factors such as energy prices, maintenance costs, and the lifespan of energy-efficient technologies.
