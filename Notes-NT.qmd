# Notes: NT

## **Energy Efficiency Policies and Regulations**

The Northern Territory faces unique challenges in ensuring energy efficiency due to its high household energy consumption, driven by extreme temperatures and the effects of climate change[^notes-nt-1]. Rising temperatures, less predictable rainfall patterns, and the increasing intensity of cyclones further emphasize the need for a sustainable and resilient energy system[^notes-nt-2]. This section outlines the key policies and regulations that govern energy efficiency in residential housing in the NT.

### **Renewable Energy Targets**

The Northern Territory Government has set a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030[^notes-nt-3]. This commitment is supported by various plans, strategies, and programs aimed at achieving a sustainable and affordable energy future for the Territory[^notes-nt-4]. The government also participates in national energy reforms through the Energy National Cabinet Reform Committee, contributing to broader opportunities for the Territory and Australia, including the national hydrogen strategy[^notes-nt-5].

### **Building Codes and Standards**

In alignment with the National Construction Code (NCC), new homes and modified homes requiring building permits in the NT must meet certain energy efficiency standards[^notes-nt-6]. These standards are designed to:

[^notes-nt-6]: Energy efficiency of residential buildings \| NT.GOV.AU, accessed on January 8, 2025, <https://nt.gov.au/property/building/build-or-renovate-your-home/energy-efficiency-of-residential-buildings>

-   Enhance the comfort of living spaces
-   Reduce energy bills over the lifetime of a home
-   Minimize greenhouse gas emissions[^notes-nt-7]

Specifically, houses must achieve a minimum 5-star energy rating, while apartments must achieve at least a 3.5-star rating[^notes-nt-8]. A recent study has shown that despite meeting minimum energy efficiency design standards, predicted energy use for thermal comfort in new detached dwellings increased by 10.4% per dwelling and 5.6% nationally in 2022 compared to 2018[^notes-nt-9]. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including:

-   **Increasing floor areas:** As new homes are built with larger floor areas, the overall energy demand for heating and cooling increases, even with improved energy efficiency measures[^notes-nt-10].
-   **Changes in household behavior:** Increased use of appliances and electronic devices, along with changing lifestyle patterns, can contribute to higher energy consumption.
-   **Limitations of minimum standards:** The minimum energy efficiency standards may not be sufficient to offset the impact of these other factors, highlighting the need for continuous improvement in building codes and standards.

The Northern Territory has adopted a variation to the NCC 2022 energy efficiency requirements for Class 1 and 10 buildings (houses and non-habitable buildings with a conditioned space)[^notes-nt-11]. This variation, which came into effect on 1 October 2023, aims to improve understanding and use of the existing variation by including it in NCC 2022[^notes-nt-12].

There are two options for complying with these requirements:

1.  Achieving an energy rating of 5 stars or greater using house energy rating software (NatHERS).
2.  Complying with NT Parts 13.1 through to 13.6 of the ABCB Housing Provisions[^notes-nt-13].

For Class 2 buildings (apartments) and Class 4 parts of a building (dwellings within a non-residential building), Section J of BCA 2009 still applies[^notes-nt-14].

### **Energy Hardship and Social Equity**

Energy hardship is a significant issue in the NT, particularly in remote communities and among households using prepayment meters[^notes-nt-15]. Many households struggle to afford the energy they need, resulting in unmanageable power bills and frequent disconnections[^notes-nt-16]. This situation can have serious consequences, including loss of food and medicine, and can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities[^notes-nt-17]. Addressing energy hardship requires a multi-faceted approach that includes:
