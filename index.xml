      <abstract>
        <p>Australian residential housing faces significant energy efficiency
challenges, with the average home achieving only 1.7 stars under the
Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS). This paper analyzes the
evolution and current state of energy efficiency policy responses across
Commonwealth, state, and local government jurisdictions. While recent
years have seen strengthened standards through the National Construction
Code and expanded financial support through programs like the $1.3
billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, implementation remains
fragmented and heavily reliant on voluntary measures. State governments
have emerged as key policy innovators, implementing market-based
mechanisms and equity-focused programs, though approaches vary
significantly across jurisdictions. Local governments demonstrate
particular strengths in community engagement and implementation support,
especially in addressing split-incentive barriers in the rental sector.
Non-government actors play increasingly important roles through
standard-setting, program delivery, and policy advocacy, though
systematic evaluation of their contributions remains limited. Analysis
reveals several priorities for strengthening policy frameworks:
establishing mandatory disclosure requirements, enhancing compliance
mechanisms, developing robust data infrastructure, addressing rental
sector barriers, and implementing comprehensive retrofit strategies for
existing housing stock. Success requires stronger cross-jurisdictional
coordination while maintaining flexibility for local adaptation. These
findings highlight the need for a more coordinated and ambitious
approach to residential energy efficiency improvement, combining
regulatory requirements with targeted support mechanisms to achieve
widespread adoption of high-performance housing.</p>

          <p>The research suggests that implementing a national mandatory
      disclosure framework for residential energy performance could
      significantly improve outcomes, with international evidence
      indicating mandatory schemes achieve 2.2% annual efficiency
      improvements compared to Australia’s current 0.3% under voluntary
      approaches.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Evidence indicates the $1.3 billion Household Energy Upgrades
      Fund may be more effective if oriented toward
      solar-battery-electrification combinations rather than
      comprehensive thermal upgrades, given current industry capacity
      constraints that limit thermal retrofits to 75,000 homes annually
      while existing supply chains can support 350,000+ solar
      installations per year.</p>

        <list-item>
          <p>Analysis points to opportunities for state governments to
      develop coordinated rental sector strategies that combine minimum
      standards with targeted financial incentives, addressing the
      observed 2.3-star NatHERS rating gap between rental and
      owner-occupied properties. Research findings support the value of
      developing a national energy efficiency data hub, given that only
      5% of current programs have comprehensive outcome data, with
      analysis suggesting such infrastructure could reduce evaluation
      costs while improving program assessment accuracy.</p>

      <title>2. Evolution of policy responses for residential energy
  efficiency</title>
      <p>Australia’s approach to residential energy efficiency policy has
  evolved from a largely unregulated domain to an increasingly complex
  policy landscape over recent decades. Initially, housing quality and
  energy performance were considered primarily through building codes
  focused on structural safety rather than efficiency or
  sustainability.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></p>
      <p>A significant shift occurred in 2003 with the introduction of
  energy efficiency standards in the National Construction Code (NCC),
  marking the first national mandatory requirements for thermal
  performance in new residential
  buildings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> However, these
  initial standards were modest by international comparison and focused
  exclusively on new construction rather than existing housing
  stock.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref></p>
      <p>The growing recognition of climate change impacts led to expanded
  policy attention in the late 2000s, including through the National
  Energy Productivity Plan (NEPP) which aimed to improve Australia’s
  energy productivity by 40% between 2015 and
  2030.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> This period saw the
  emergence of various state-based initiatives and the development of
  rating tools like the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme
  (NatHERS).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref></p>
      <p>The 2010s marked increased attention to rental housing standards,
  though primarily through voluntary approaches rather than regulation.
  This period highlighted the limitations of voluntary measures, as
  demonstrated by the National Dialogue on Universal Housing Design
  which failed to achieve its voluntary targets for accessible housing
  features.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref></p>
      <p>Recent years have seen a gradual strengthening of standards,
  exemplified by the 2022 NCC update requiring new homes to achieve the
  equivalent of 7-stars under
  NatHERS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">7</xref> However, implementation
  remains inconsistent across jurisdictions, with some states delaying
  or declining to adopt higher
  standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref></p>
      <p>The current policy landscape is characterized by fragmentation
  across multiple levels of government, with responsibilities divided
  between Commonwealth, state/territory and local authorities. This
  creates challenges for consistent implementation and
  enforcement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref> The system relies
  heavily on voluntary measures, particularly for existing housing
  stock, which comprises the majority of residential
  buildings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10">10</xref> This fragmented
  approach, combined with the predominance of voluntary mechanisms, has
  resulted in slower progress compared to international peers in
  improving residential energy
  efficiency.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">11</xref></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="commonwealth-government-interventions">
      <title>3. Commonwealth Government Interventions</title>
      <p>The Commonwealth Government has employed several key policy
  mechanisms to improve residential energy efficiency, though their
  effectiveness has been limited by fragmented implementation and a
  reliance on voluntary measures. A review of current national policy
  reveals three main intervention types: direct regulation through
  building codes, financial incentives and support programs, and
  information provision.</p>
      <p>The primary regulatory instrument at the national level is the
  National Construction Code (NCC), which since 2003 has prescribed
  energy efficiency standards for newly built and substantially
  renovated homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12">12</xref> While the
  2022 NCC update increased minimum thermal performance requirements
  from 6 to 7 stars under NatHERS, implementation remains inconsistent
  across jurisdictions with some states delaying or declining to adopt
  higher standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13">13</xref></p>
      <p>The Commonwealth has significantly expanded its financial
  mechanisms for supporting residential energy efficiency improvements.
  The $1.3 billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, announced in the
  2023-24 Budget, represents the largest ever federal investment in this
  area. Through this fund, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will
  partner with banks and lenders to provide low-cost finance for energy
  performance upgrades to over 110,000
  homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14">14</xref> Additionally, $300
  million has been allocated for upgrades to approximately 60,000 social
  housing properties, addressing equity concerns in energy efficiency
  improvements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15">15</xref></p>
      <p>Information provision forms the third pillar of Commonwealth
  intervention, primarily through the Your Home guide and energy.gov.au
  website which provide guidance on building, buying or renovating
  sustainable homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16">16</xref> The
  government has also developed the Nationwide House Energy Rating
  Scheme (NatHERS) to provide reliable energy performance ratings,
  though its application remains largely limited to new
  construction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17">17</xref></p>
      <p>The policy approach is guided by the Trajectory for Low Energy
  Buildings, which aims to achieve zero energy and carbon-ready
  buildings. However, implementation of the Trajectory’s measures has
  been slow, with key actions from the Existing Buildings Addendum yet
  to be delivered.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18">18</xref> This includes
  the development of a national framework for energy efficiency
  disclosure and minimum rental standards.</p>
      <p>The effectiveness of Commonwealth interventions has been
  constrained by several factors. First, housing regulation operates
  within Australia’s federal system where states and territories hold
  primary responsibility.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19">19</xref> This
  has resulted in inconsistent adoption of national frameworks. Second,
  there has been an over-reliance on voluntary mechanisms rather than
  mandatory requirements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20">20</xref> Third,
  policy has focused predominantly on new construction rather than
  addressing the existing housing stock which comprises the majority of
  dwellings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21">21</xref></p>

      <title>4. State or Territory Government Interventions</title>
      <p>State governments have emerged as key drivers of residential energy
  efficiency policy in Australia, implementing varied approaches that
  reflect both jurisdictional priorities and local market conditions.
  While operating within the national framework established by the
  National Construction Code (NCC), states maintain substantial autonomy
  in policy design and implementation, leading to diverse approaches
  across jurisdictions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22">22</xref> The

      <p>The implementation of enhanced building energy standards
  illustrates this jurisdictional variation. Following the 2022 NCC
  update increasing minimum thermal performance requirements to 7-stars
  under NatHERS, adoption patterns have varied significantly. The ACT
  and NSW led implementation, with Victoria and Queensland following in
  May 2024, while Western Australia delayed adoption until 2025.
  Tasmania opted not to adopt the new standard, and the Northern
  Territory chose to implement only a 5-star
  requirement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23">23</xref></p>
      <p>Several states have developed sophisticated market-based mechanisms
  to drive energy efficiency improvements. Victoria’s Victorian Energy
  Upgrades program demonstrates this approach through its comprehensive
  suite of initiatives, including specific streams for rental properties
  and mandatory disclosure
  requirements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24">24</xref> Similarly, NSW’s
  Energy Security Safeguard has pioneered innovative policy design,
  while Queensland’s Energy Savers Program offers targeted support for
  energy efficiency
  improvements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25">25</xref></p>
      <p>States have increasingly incorporated equity considerations into
  program design. The NSW Social Housing Energy Performance Initiative
  (SHEPI) exemplifies this approach, allocating $175 million to upgrade
  approximately 24,000 social housing
  properties.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26">26</xref> Victoria’s Solar
  for Rentals program directly addresses split incentive barriers in the
  rental market through targeted incentives and support
  mechanisms.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27">27</xref></p>
      <p>Implementation support has evolved beyond simple financial
  incentives. Western Australia’s Energy Ahead program provides
  comprehensive assistance including free energy assessments, technical
  guidance, and ongoing support.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28">28</xref>
  South Australia’s Virtual Power Plant program combines technology
  deployment with sophisticated grid integration, demonstrating how
  implementation support can advance both household and system-wide
  objectives.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29">29</xref></p>
      <p>Recent state initiatives show increasing attention to policy
  integration and market development. Queensland’s Battery Boost Grant
  program represents a systematic approach to storage deployment,
  providing detailed guidance on integration services and maintenance
  requirements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30">30</xref> The Victorian
  Gas Substitution Roadmap demonstrates sophisticated policy mechanisms
  through its coordinated approach to electrification and efficiency
  improvements, which has operated continuously since 2020 while
  expanding in scope and
  ambition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31">31</xref></p>

    <sec id="local-government-interventions">
      <title>5. Local Government interventions</title>
      <p>Local governments across Australia have developed distinctive
  approaches to residential energy efficiency policy, implementing
  programs that leverage their close community connections and local
  planning powers. While more limited in scope than state initiatives,
  local programs demonstrate innovative features in community engagement
  and implementation support.</p>
      <p>Metropolitan councils have led policy development, with larger
  urban authorities implementing comprehensive programs that combine
  multiple intervention types. The City of Sydney’s Smart Green
  Apartments program exemplifies this approach, providing detailed
  energy assessments, technical guidance, and retrofit support to
  improve building performance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32">32</xref>
  Similarly, the City of Melbourne’s Zero Net Carbon Homes program
  offers integrated support for sustainable building design and
  construction, demonstrating how local authorities can address specific
  building typology
  challenges.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33">33</xref></p>
      <p>Local governments have shown particular innovation in community
  engagement approaches. Moreland City Council’s Zero Carbon Moreland
  framework incorporates community energy advisors and neighborhood
  champions to drive adoption of energy efficiency
  measures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34">34</xref> The City of

      <title>6. Activity by non-government actors</title>
      <p>Non-government actors have played an increasingly significant role
  in advancing residential energy efficiency in Australia, though
  systematic documentation of their independent initiatives remains
  limited. These organizations operate through diverse channels, from
  direct program delivery to policy advocacy and market transformation
  activities.</p>
      <p>Industry bodies have emerged as important standard-setters and
  capability builders. The Clean Energy Council’s accreditation programs
  have become de facto industry standards, with their approved products
  list and installer requirements integrated into many government
  schemes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42">42</xref> The Green Building
  Council of Australia has driven market transformation through
  voluntary rating tools and professional development programs, while
  the Property Council has facilitated knowledge sharing on emerging
  technologies and implementation
  approaches.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43">43</xref></p>
      <p>The community housing sector has demonstrated particular innovation
  in program delivery, especially in addressing the needs of vulnerable
  households. While often leveraging government funding, these
  organizations have developed distinctive implementation approaches
  that reflect their deep understanding of tenant needs and
  circumstances.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44">44</xref> The Community
  Housing Industry Association’s Sustainable Housing Initiative
  exemplifies this approach, combining technical guidance with tenant
  engagement strategies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45">45</xref></p>
      <p>Environmental and consumer advocacy organizations have contributed
  significantly to policy development and program design. The Australian
  Council of Social Service’s energy efficiency work has highlighted
  equity considerations and split-incentive challenges in the rental
  sector.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46">46</xref> Environment Victoria’s
  One Million Homes Alliance has developed detailed policy proposals
  while building broad stakeholder support for ambitious efficiency
  standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47">47</xref></p>
      <p>The experience of voluntary industry initiatives provides important
  lessons about the limitations of non-regulatory approaches. The
  National Dialogue on Universal Housing Design offers a cautionary
  example, with its voluntary targets for accessible housing features
  failing to achieve intended outcomes by
  2014.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48">48</xref> This experience
  highlights the importance of combining voluntary initiatives with
  appropriate regulatory frameworks and accountability mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Analysis of current residential energy efficiency policies reveals
  several areas where non-government actors could potentially play
  expanded roles. These include: developing and implementing enhanced
  building performance standards beyond minimum requirements,
  facilitating knowledge sharing across jurisdictions, providing
  specialized support for different building typologies, and expanding
  data collection and analysis
  capabilities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49">49</xref></p>
      <p>However, significant gaps exist in the documentation and evaluation
  of non-government initiatives in this sector. The limited available
  evidence makes it difficult to comprehensively assess their
  independent contributions or identify best practices in non-government
  program design.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50">50</xref> This suggests
  a pressing need for more systematic research examining the role and
  effectiveness of non-government actors in advancing residential energy
  efficiency.</p>

    <sec id="opportunities-and-next-steps-for-the-policy-agenda">
      <title>7. Opportunities and next steps for the policy agenda</title>
      <p>The analysis of current residential energy efficiency policy in
  Australia reveals several clear opportunities for strengthening
  relevant frameworks to accelerate the transition to energy efficient
  homes. These opportunities span multiple governance levels and require
  careful coordination across jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>Several priorities emerge, which are discussed summarily in this
  section, with more detailed treatment in the following sections of the
  following opportunities: selection and deployment of retrofit
  technologies (see Section 9), development of innovative financing
  mechanisms enabling widespread adoption (Section 10), community
  engagement and behavior change strategies (Section 11), and
  integration of household improvements with broader electricity system
  transformation (Section 12).</p>
      <p>A primary regulatory priority is establishing mandatory disclosure
  requirements for residential energy performance. Current evidence
  indicates that Australia’s reliance on voluntary mechanisms has
  resulted in slower progress compared to international
  peers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51">51</xref> Mandatory disclosure at
  point of sale and lease, coupled with minimum energy efficiency
  standards for rental properties, would create stronger market signals
  while protecting vulnerable
  households.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52">52</xref></p>
      <p>Enhanced compliance mechanisms represent another crucial area for
  development. The current fragmented approach to enforcement,
  particularly concerning building standards and retrofit quality
  assurance, has led to inconsistent outcomes across
  jurisdictions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53">53</xref> Establishing a
  nationally coordinated compliance framework, with clear roles for
  state and local authorities, would help ensure consistent
  implementation of existing standards while supporting the introduction
  of enhanced requirements.</p>
      <p>Data infrastructure development emerges as a critical enabling
  priority. Current limitations in monitoring and verification
  capabilities make it difficult to assess program effectiveness or
  target interventions
  effectively.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54">54</xref> A coordinated
  approach to data collection and analysis, potentially through a
  national energy efficiency data hub, would support evidence-based
  policy refinement while enabling better tracking of outcomes.</p>
      <p>Regarding energy efficiency options, evidence suggests that solar
  and batteries (combined) represent the most promising path forward,
  along with full electrification. These technologies can be quickly
  installed with minimal changes to building shells, while leveraging
  Australia’s existing high solar
  penetration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55">55</xref> Research
  indicates this approach could reduce average household energy bills by
  approximately $2,200 annually when combined with electrification of
  key appliances.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56">56</xref></p>
      <p>The rental sector requires particular attention, with current split
  incentive barriers continuing to impede improvements in this growing
  segment of the housing market.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57">57</xref>
  Enhanced minimum standards for rental properties, supported by
  targeted financial incentives and clear compliance pathways, could
  help address this persistent challenge while protecting
  affordability.</p>
      <p>Financing mechanisms emerge as perhaps the most critical priority.
  Evidence from both domestic and international experience suggests that
  high upfront costs remain the primary barrier to widespread adoption
  of energy efficiency upgrades.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58">58</xref>
  Innovative financing approaches from jurisdictions like the United
  States, particularly the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) and
  Inclusive Utility Investment (IUI) programs, warrant careful
  consideration for the Australian context. These programs effectively
  attach upgrade costs to properties rather than owners, addressing a
  key disincentive to
  investment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59">59</xref></p>
      <p>The role of industry engagement and workforce development requires
  greater attention. Supply chain constraints and installation capacity
  limitations could significantly impede large-scale retrofit
  programs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60">60</xref> A coordinated
  approach to industry development, including training programs and
  quality assurance frameworks, will be essential for successful
  implementation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="retrofit-technology-and-implementation-pathways">
      <title>8. Retrofit Technology and Implementation Pathways</title>
      <p>The choice of retrofit technology and implementation pathway
  emerges as a critical consideration for policy development. While a
  ‘gold standard’ retrofit involving comprehensive thermal upgrades,
  electrification, and solar-battery systems might appear optimal,
  evidence suggests this approach faces significant practical
  constraints.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61">61</xref> Implementation
  experience indicates that thermal-first retrofits, while theoretically
  beneficial, present particular challenges in terms of cost,
  disruption, and industry
  capacity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62">62</xref></p>
      <p>Recent analysis indicates solar and battery combinations, coupled
  with electrification, may offer a more pragmatic pathway. This
  approach leverages Australia’s existing high solar penetration while
  minimizing structural modifications to
  homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63">63</xref> The rapid installation
  timeframes - typically 1-2 days versus 2-4 weeks for comprehensive
  thermal upgrades - also support faster scaled
  deployment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64">64</xref> However, careful
  attention must be paid to grid stability implications as distributed
  generation increases.</p>
      <p>Industry capacity emerges as a critical constraint. Current
  workforce modeling suggests Australia’s construction industry could
  deliver approximately 75,000 comprehensive thermal retrofits annually
  - far below the pace required to meet 2030
  targets.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65">65</xref> Supply chain
  limitations, particularly for insulation materials and heat pumps,
  could further constrain
  delivery.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66">66</xref> These constraints
  suggest policy should prioritize technologies and approaches that can
  be rapidly scaled with existing industry capabilities.</p>
      <p>The emergence of technology platforms like BOOM! offers potential
  solutions for retrofit optimization. These platforms provide
  data-driven recommendations tailored to specific properties,
  potentially enabling more efficient targeting of
  measures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67">67</xref> However, their
  effectiveness depends on access to detailed housing stock data that is
  currently limited in many jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>A staged transition from voluntary to mandatory approaches warrants
  consideration. Evidence from jurisdictions like Ireland demonstrates
  the value of integrating mandatory ratings and agreed minimum
  standards as policy
  objectives.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68">68</xref> This could begin
  with voluntary disclosure supported by incentives, progressing to
  mandatory disclosure at transaction points, and ultimately to minimum
  standards at specified trigger points.</p>
      <p>Critical success factors for implementation include: - Development
  of standardized assessment protocols to ensure consistent delivery -
  Establishment of quality assurance frameworks covering both products
  and installation - Creation of clear certification pathways for
  installers and assessors - Integration of monitoring and verification
  systems to track outcomes - Design of consumer protection mechanisms
  to build confidence<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69">69</xref></p>

    <sec id="financial-mechanisms-for-energy-efficiency">
      <title>9. Financial Mechanisms for Energy Efficiency</title>
      <p>Financing mechanisms emerge as perhaps the most critical enabler
  for widespread residential energy efficiency improvements. Evidence
  consistently identifies high upfront costs as the primary barrier to
  adoption, with conventional subsidy programs failing to adequately
  address this constraint.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70">70</xref>
  International experience suggests innovative financing models that
  decouple payment from individual homeowners offer promising
  solutions.</p>
      <p>The Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) model from the United
  States warrants particular attention. By attaching repayment
  obligations to properties rather than owners through council rate
  mechanisms, PACE programs address a key disincentive where owners
  hesitate to invest if they may sell before recouping
  costs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71">71</xref> However, implementation
  in Australia would require careful consideration of jurisdictional
  arrangements given differences in local government capacity and rating
  systems.</p>
      <p>The Inclusive Utility Investment (IUI) approach offers an
  alternative pathway, with energy retailers providing financing repaid
  through electricity bills. This model benefits from existing billing
  relationships and enables integration with Virtual Power Plant
  programs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72">72</xref> Australia’s National
  Renewable Network demonstrates the potential of this approach, though
  regulatory changes may be needed to enable wider
  adoption.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73">73</xref></p>
      <p>The Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s planned Household Energy
  Upgrades Fund presents opportunities to scale these approaches. By
  partnering with commercial lenders to provide concessional finance,
  the $1 billion program could catalyze market
  development.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74">74</xref> However, evidence
  from similar programs suggests success depends on standardized
  assessment protocols and robust contractor accreditation
  frameworks.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75">75</xref></p>
      <p>Equity considerations require particular attention in financing
  design. Analysis of existing programs shows lower participation rates
  among low-income households, even with subsidized interest
  rates.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76">76</xref> Models like South
  Australia’s “Switch for Solar” program, which allows concession

      <title>10. Community Engagement and Behavioural Dimensions</title>
      <p>The success of residential energy efficiency initiatives depends
  critically on household behavior and community acceptance. Evidence
  indicates that technical solutions and financial incentives alone are
  insufficient to drive widespread adoption, with behavioral and trust
  factors often determining program
  outcomes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79">79</xref> Recent research
  reveals significant challenges in household willingness to transition
  from gas and adopt new technologies, even when clear economic benefits
  exist.</p>
      <p>Trust in renewable energy technologies emerges as a crucial factor.
  Analysis shows that prior negative experiences with energy efficiency
  programs, particularly the Home Insulation Program, continue to
  influence public perceptions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80">80</xref>
  This suggests the need for carefully designed demonstration projects
  and community validation mechanisms. Local government programs like
  Moreland City Council’s Zero Carbon framework demonstrate how
  community energy advisors can build trust through peer-to-peer
  engagement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81">81</xref></p>
      <p>The “rebound effect” in energy consumption presents a particular
  challenge. Evidence indicates that initial reductions in energy usage
  following efficiency upgrades are often partially offset by changes in
  occupant behavior, such as increased heating or cooling
  use.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82">82</xref> This suggests the need
  for ongoing engagement and feedback mechanisms rather than one-off
  interventions.</p>
      <p>Community-based social marketing approaches show promise in
  addressing these challenges. Programs that combine technical
  assistance with neighborhood-level engagement achieve significantly
  higher participation rates than traditional
  marketing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83">83</xref> The ACT’s
  Sustainable Household Scheme demonstrates the effectiveness of
  combining financial incentives with community education and
  support.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84">84</xref></p>
      <p>The role of information asymmetry warrants particular attention.
  Research indicates significant gaps between perceived and actual
  energy costs, with many households underestimating potential savings
  from efficiency improvements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85">85</xref>
  Real-time energy monitoring and comparative feedback mechanisms show
  promise in addressing this barrier, though careful attention to

      <abstract>
        <p>Australian residential housing faces significant energy efficiency
challenges, with the average home achieving only 1.7 stars under the
Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS). This paper analyzes the
evolution and current state of energy efficiency policy responses across
Commonwealth, state, and local government jurisdictions. While recent
years have seen strengthened standards through the National Construction
Code and expanded financial support through programs like the $1.3
billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, implementation remains
fragmented and heavily reliant on voluntary measures. State governments
have emerged as key policy innovators, implementing market-based
mechanisms and equity-focused programs, though approaches vary
significantly across jurisdictions. Local governments demonstrate
particular strengths in community engagement and implementation support,
especially in addressing split-incentive barriers in the rental sector.
Non-government actors play increasingly important roles through
standard-setting, program delivery, and policy advocacy, though
systematic evaluation of their contributions remains limited. Analysis
reveals several priorities for strengthening policy frameworks:
establishing mandatory disclosure requirements, enhancing compliance
mechanisms, developing robust data infrastructure, addressing rental
sector barriers, and implementing comprehensive retrofit strategies for
existing housing stock. Success requires stronger cross-jurisdictional
coordination while maintaining flexibility for local adaptation. These
findings highlight the need for a more coordinated and ambitious
approach to residential energy efficiency improvement, combining
regulatory requirements with targeted support mechanisms to achieve
widespread adoption of high-performance housing.</p>

            <p>The research suggests that implementing a national mandatory

            <p>Analysis points to opportunities for state governments to

      observed 2.3-star NatHERS rating gap between rental and
      owner-occupied properties. Research findings support the value of
      developing a national energy efficiency data hub, given that only
      5% of current programs have comprehensive outcome data, with

        <title>2. Evolution of policy responses for residential energy
  efficiency</title>
        <p>Australia’s approach to residential energy efficiency policy has
  evolved from a largely unregulated domain to an increasingly complex
  policy landscape over recent decades. Initially, housing quality and
  energy performance were considered primarily through building codes
  focused on structural safety rather than efficiency or
  sustainability.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-article">1</xref></p>
        <p>A significant shift occurred in 2003 with the introduction of
  energy efficiency standards in the National Construction Code (NCC),
  marking the first national mandatory requirements for thermal
  performance in new residential
  buildings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-article">2</xref> However, these
  initial standards were modest by international comparison and focused
  exclusively on new construction rather than existing housing
  stock.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-article">3</xref></p>
        <p>The growing recognition of climate change impacts led to expanded
  policy attention in the late 2000s, including through the National
  Energy Productivity Plan (NEPP) which aimed to improve Australia’s
  energy productivity by 40% between 2015 and
  2030.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-nb-article">4</xref> This period saw the
  emergence of various state-based initiatives and the development of
  rating tools like the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme
  (NatHERS).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-nb-article">5</xref></p>
        <p>The 2010s marked increased attention to rental housing standards,
  though primarily through voluntary approaches rather than regulation.
  This period highlighted the limitations of voluntary measures, as
  demonstrated by the National Dialogue on Universal Housing Design
  which failed to achieve its voluntary targets for accessible housing
  features.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-nb-article">6</xref></p>
        <p>Recent years have seen a gradual strengthening of standards,
  exemplified by the 2022 NCC update requiring new homes to achieve the
  equivalent of 7-stars under
  NatHERS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-nb-article">7</xref> However, implementation
  remains inconsistent across jurisdictions, with some states delaying
  or declining to adopt higher
  standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-nb-article">8</xref></p>
        <p>The current policy landscape is characterized by fragmentation
  across multiple levels of government, with responsibilities divided
  between Commonwealth, state/territory and local authorities. This
  creates challenges for consistent implementation and
  enforcement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-nb-article">9</xref> The system relies
  heavily on voluntary measures, particularly for existing housing
  stock, which comprises the majority of residential
  buildings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-nb-article">10</xref> This fragmented
  approach, combined with the predominance of voluntary mechanisms, has
  resulted in slower progress compared to international peers in
  improving residential energy
  efficiency.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-nb-article">11</xref></p>

      <sec id="commonwealth-government-interventions-nb-article">
        <title>3. Commonwealth Government Interventions</title>
        <p>The Commonwealth Government has employed several key policy
  mechanisms to improve residential energy efficiency, though their
  effectiveness has been limited by fragmented implementation and a
  reliance on voluntary measures. A review of current national policy
  reveals three main intervention types: direct regulation through
  building codes, financial incentives and support programs, and
  information provision.</p>
        <p>The primary regulatory instrument at the national level is the
  National Construction Code (NCC), which since 2003 has prescribed
  energy efficiency standards for newly built and substantially
  renovated homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-nb-article">12</xref> While the
  2022 NCC update increased minimum thermal performance requirements
  from 6 to 7 stars under NatHERS, implementation remains inconsistent
  across jurisdictions with some states delaying or declining to adopt
  higher standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-nb-article">13</xref></p>
        <p>The Commonwealth has significantly expanded its financial
  mechanisms for supporting residential energy efficiency improvements.
  The $1.3 billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, announced in the
  2023-24 Budget, represents the largest ever federal investment in this
  area. Through this fund, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will
  partner with banks and lenders to provide low-cost finance for energy
  performance upgrades to over 110,000
  homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-nb-article">14</xref> Additionally, $300
  million has been allocated for upgrades to approximately 60,000 social
  housing properties, addressing equity concerns in energy efficiency
  improvements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-nb-article">15</xref></p>
        <p>Information provision forms the third pillar of Commonwealth
  intervention, primarily through the Your Home guide and energy.gov.au
  website which provide guidance on building, buying or renovating
  sustainable homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-nb-article">16</xref> The
  government has also developed the Nationwide House Energy Rating
  Scheme (NatHERS) to provide reliable energy performance ratings,
  though its application remains largely limited to new
  construction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-nb-article">17</xref></p>
        <p>The policy approach is guided by the Trajectory for Low Energy
  Buildings, which aims to achieve zero energy and carbon-ready
  buildings. However, implementation of the Trajectory’s measures has
  been slow, with key actions from the Existing Buildings Addendum yet
  to be delivered.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-nb-article">18</xref> This includes
  the development of a national framework for energy efficiency
  disclosure and minimum rental standards.</p>
        <p>The effectiveness of Commonwealth interventions has been
  constrained by several factors. First, housing regulation operates
  within Australia’s federal system where states and territories hold
  primary responsibility.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-nb-article">19</xref> This
  has resulted in inconsistent adoption of national frameworks. Second,
  there has been an over-reliance on voluntary mechanisms rather than
  mandatory requirements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-nb-article">20</xref> Third,
  policy has focused predominantly on new construction rather than
  addressing the existing housing stock which comprises the majority of
  dwellings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-nb-article">21</xref></p>

  in advancing residential energy efficiency in Australia, though
  systematic documentation of their independent initiatives remains
  limited. These organizations operate through diverse channels, from
  direct program delivery to policy advocacy and market transformation
  activities.</p>
        <p>Industry bodies have emerged as important standard-setters and

  Housing Industry Association’s Sustainable Housing Initiative
  exemplifies this approach, combining technical guidance with tenant
  engagement strategies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-nb-article">45</xref></p>
        <p>Environmental and consumer advocacy organizations have contributed

  equity considerations and split-incentive challenges in the rental
  sector.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-nb-article">46</xref> Environment Victoria’s
  One Million Homes Alliance has developed detailed policy proposals
  while building broad stakeholder support for ambitious efficiency
  standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-nb-article">47</xref></p>
        <p>The experience of voluntary industry initiatives provides important
  lessons about the limitations of non-regulatory approaches. The

        <title>7. Opportunities and next steps for the policy agenda</title>
        <p>The analysis of current residential energy efficiency policy in
  Australia reveals several clear opportunities for strengthening
  relevant frameworks to accelerate the transition to energy efficient
  homes. These opportunities span multiple governance levels and require
  careful coordination across jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>Several priorities emerge, which are discussed summarily in this
  section, with more detailed treatment in the following sections of the
  following opportunities: selection and deployment of retrofit
  technologies (see Section 9), development of innovative financing
  mechanisms enabling widespread adoption (Section 10), community
  engagement and behavior change strategies (Section 11), and
  integration of household improvements with broader electricity system
  transformation (Section 12).</p>
        <p>A primary regulatory priority is establishing mandatory disclosure
  requirements for residential energy performance. Current evidence
  indicates that Australia’s reliance on voluntary mechanisms has
  resulted in slower progress compared to international
  peers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-nb-article">51</xref> Mandatory disclosure at
  point of sale and lease, coupled with minimum energy efficiency
  standards for rental properties, would create stronger market signals
  while protecting vulnerable
  households.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-nb-article">52</xref></p>
        <p>Enhanced compliance mechanisms represent another crucial area for
  development. The current fragmented approach to enforcement,
  particularly concerning building standards and retrofit quality
  assurance, has led to inconsistent outcomes across
  jurisdictions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-nb-article">53</xref> Establishing a
  nationally coordinated compliance framework, with clear roles for
  state and local authorities, would help ensure consistent
  implementation of existing standards while supporting the introduction
  of enhanced requirements.</p>
        <p>Data infrastructure development emerges as a critical enabling
  priority. Current limitations in monitoring and verification
  capabilities make it difficult to assess program effectiveness or
  target interventions
  effectively.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-nb-article">54</xref> A coordinated
  approach to data collection and analysis, potentially through a
  national energy efficiency data hub, would support evidence-based
  policy refinement while enabling better tracking of outcomes.</p>
        <p>Regarding energy efficiency options, evidence suggests that solar
  and batteries (combined) represent the most promising path forward,
  along with full electrification. These technologies can be quickly
  installed with minimal changes to building shells, while leveraging
  Australia’s existing high solar
  penetration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-nb-article">55</xref> Research
  indicates this approach could reduce average household energy bills by
  approximately $2,200 annually when combined with electrification of
  key appliances.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-nb-article">56</xref></p>
        <p>The rental sector requires particular attention, with current split
  incentive barriers continuing to impede improvements in this growing
  segment of the housing market.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-nb-article">57</xref>
  Enhanced minimum standards for rental properties, supported by
  targeted financial incentives and clear compliance pathways, could
  help address this persistent challenge while protecting
  affordability.</p>
        <p>Financing mechanisms emerge as perhaps the most critical priority.
  Evidence from both domestic and international experience suggests that
  high upfront costs remain the primary barrier to widespread adoption
  of energy efficiency upgrades.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-nb-article">58</xref>
  Innovative financing approaches from jurisdictions like the United
  States, particularly the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) and
  Inclusive Utility Investment (IUI) programs, warrant careful
  consideration for the Australian context. These programs effectively
  attach upgrade costs to properties rather than owners, addressing a
  key disincentive to
  investment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-nb-article">59</xref></p>
        <p>The role of industry engagement and workforce development requires
  greater attention. Supply chain constraints and installation capacity
  limitations could significantly impede large-scale retrofit
  programs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-nb-article">60</xref> A coordinated
  approach to industry development, including training programs and
  quality assurance frameworks, will be essential for successful
  implementation.</p>

        <title>8. Retrofit Technology and Implementation Pathways</title>
        <p>The choice of retrofit technology and implementation pathway
  emerges as a critical consideration for policy development. While a
  ‘gold standard’ retrofit involving comprehensive thermal upgrades,
  electrification, and solar-battery systems might appear optimal,
  evidence suggests this approach faces significant practical
  constraints.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-nb-article">61</xref> Implementation
  experience indicates that thermal-first retrofits, while theoretically
  beneficial, present particular challenges in terms of cost,
  disruption, and industry
  capacity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-nb-article">62</xref></p>
        <p>Recent analysis indicates solar and battery combinations, coupled
  with electrification, may offer a more pragmatic pathway. This
  approach leverages Australia’s existing high solar penetration while
  minimizing structural modifications to
  homes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-nb-article">63</xref> The rapid installation
  timeframes - typically 1-2 days versus 2-4 weeks for comprehensive
  thermal upgrades - also support faster scaled
  deployment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-nb-article">64</xref> However, careful
  attention must be paid to grid stability implications as distributed
  generation increases.</p>
        <p>Industry capacity emerges as a critical constraint. Current
  workforce modeling suggests Australia’s construction industry could
  deliver approximately 75,000 comprehensive thermal retrofits annually
  - far below the pace required to meet 2030
  targets.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-nb-article">65</xref> Supply chain
  limitations, particularly for insulation materials and heat pumps,
  could further constrain
  delivery.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-nb-article">66</xref> These constraints
  suggest policy should prioritize technologies and approaches that can
  be rapidly scaled with existing industry capabilities.</p>
        <p>The emergence of technology platforms like BOOM! offers potential
  solutions for retrofit optimization. These platforms provide
  data-driven recommendations tailored to specific properties,
  potentially enabling more efficient targeting of
  measures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-nb-article">67</xref> However, their
  effectiveness depends on access to detailed housing stock data that is
  currently limited in many jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>A staged transition from voluntary to mandatory approaches warrants
  consideration. Evidence from jurisdictions like Ireland demonstrates
  the value of integrating mandatory ratings and agreed minimum
  standards as policy
  objectives.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-nb-article">68</xref> This could begin
  with voluntary disclosure supported by incentives, progressing to
  mandatory disclosure at transaction points, and ultimately to minimum
  standards at specified trigger points.</p>
        <p>Critical success factors for implementation include: - Development
  of standardized assessment protocols to ensure consistent delivery -
  Establishment of quality assurance frameworks covering both products
  and installation - Creation of clear certification pathways for
  installers and assessors - Integration of monitoring and verification
  systems to track outcomes - Design of consumer protection mechanisms

  adoption, with conventional subsidy programs failing to adequately
  address this constraint.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-nb-article">70</xref>
  International experience suggests innovative financing models that
  decouple payment from individual homeowners offer promising
  solutions.</p>
        <p>The Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) model from the United
  States warrants particular attention. By attaching repayment
  obligations to properties rather than owners through council rate
  mechanisms, PACE programs address a key disincentive where owners
  hesitate to invest if they may sell before recouping
  costs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-nb-article">71</xref> However, implementation
  in Australia would require careful consideration of jurisdictional
  arrangements given differences in local government capacity and rating
  systems.</p>
        <p>The Inclusive Utility Investment (IUI) approach offers an
  alternative pathway, with energy retailers providing financing repaid
  through electricity bills. This model benefits from existing billing

  residential batteries can provide system services while delivering
  household benefits.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-nb-article">88</xref> The
  expansion of VPP capabilities could help address renewable energy
  intermittency while creating additional value streams for household
  investments.</p>
        <p>Transmission infrastructure planning requires careful
  consideration. Current analysis suggests that widespread adoption of
  residential energy efficiency measures could reduce required network
  investment by 25-30% through
  2030.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-nb-article">89</xref> However, this depends on
  effective coordination between efficiency programs and network
  planning processes to ensure benefits are captured.</p>
        <p>The role of community batteries presents an alternative to
  individual household storage. Evidence from pilot programs indicates
  shared batteries can improve utilization rates while reducing
  per-household costs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-nb-article">90</xref> The
  Commonwealth Government’s community battery initiative provides
  opportunities to test different ownership and operation models.</p>
        <p>Network tariff reform emerges as an enabling factor. Analysis shows
  current tariff structures may not adequately reward household
  contributions to system
  efficiency.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-nb-article">91</xref> Reforms that
  better align price signals with system costs could improve the
  economics of household investments while supporting efficient grid
  operation.</p>
        <p>Implementation priorities for infrastructure integration include: -
  Development of standardized VPP communication protocols -
  Establishment of coordinated planning processes - Creation of
  frameworks for valuing local network services - Integration of
  efficiency programs with network investment plans - Design of tariff
  structures that support efficient
  outcomes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-nb-article">92</xref></p>

            <p>Victoria has implemented stringent energy efficiency
      requirements for new homes to reduce energy consumption,
      greenhouse gas emissions, and improve occupant
      comfort<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-2">1</xref>. The state aims to
      achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and has set ambitious targets
      to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45-50% from 2005 levels by
      2030<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-2">2</xref>. Given that residential
      buildings are a significant contributor to Australia’s overall
      emissions, they represent a key area for
      improvement<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-2">3</xref>.</p>

              </title>
              <p>In 2022, Victoria raised the minimum energy efficiency
        building standards for new homes from 6 to 7
        stars<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-nb-2">4</xref>. This change
        necessitates improvements in insulation, window glazing, and the
        use of energy-efficient appliances in new
        homes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-nb-2">5</xref>. The 7-star standard
        ensures that new homes are designed and built to minimize energy
        consumption and maximize thermal comfort. Notably, this shift
        towards higher energy efficiency standards has created a demand
        for new skills and occupations in the building sector, with
        professionals now required to design and implement these
        energy-efficient
        measures<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-nb-2">6</xref>.</p>
              <p>To support the transition to 7-star homes, Sustainability
        Victoria’s 7 Star Homes program provided rebates and
        verification assessments to builders and land
        developers<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-nb-2">7</xref>. This program
        aimed to accelerate the adoption of energy-efficient practices
        in the residential building market. For instance, the program
        offered $4,000 rebates per home, for up to 4 homes built, to
        assist with upgrade costs and provided as-built verification
        assessments to ensure homes are built to achieve the same
        efficiency rating as
        designed<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-nb-2">8</xref>.</p>

        new homes, renovations, alterations, and
        additions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-nb-2">9</xref>. The NCC aims to
        enhance the sustainability and liveability of buildings by

        amenity<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-nb-2">10</xref>.</p>
              <p>Performance requirement H6P1 in the NCC mandates that
        habitable rooms and conditioned spaces use less energy than the
        calculated heating and cooling
        loads<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-nb-2">11</xref>. This requirement
        promotes the construction of building fabrics that minimize

          <p>Recognizing that existing homes constitute a substantial portion
    of the housing stock, Victoria has implemented various programs and
    initiatives to improve their energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>The One Million Homes Alliance, a collaborative effort between
    leading environment, social sector, local government, and consumer
    organizations, is committed to transforming the efficiency and
    affordability of Victoria’s

    to deliver a single, integrated approach to energy efficiency
    standards and labeling. This involves setting minimum energy
    performance standards (MEPS) for appliances and equipment before
    they can be sold, and providing energy efficiency information
    through labels to help consumers make informed purchasing
    decisions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-nb-3">21</xref>.</p>
          <p>The E3 Program plays a crucial role in reducing energy
    consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector

    the development and adoption of energy-efficient appliances and
    equipment, the program contributes to reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions and supports the transition to Net
    Zero<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-nb-3">22</xref>. Examples of appliances
    covered by the program include refrigerators, washing machines, and
    air conditioners. The energy rating labels provide consumers with

            <bold>Conclusion</bold>
          </title>
          <p>Queensland has implemented a range of policies, regulations,
    schemes, and initiatives to promote energy efficiency in residential
    housing. These measures aim to improve the energy performance of
    homes, reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions,
    and help households save money on their energy bills. The
    government’s commitment to energy efficiency is evident in programs
    like the NCC 2022, the Social Housing Energy Performance Initiative,
    and the Climate Smart Energy Savers Program.</p>
          <p>While these initiatives demonstrate a strong commitment to energy
    efficiency, there are potential areas for improvement. Concerns have
    been raised about the potential for Queensland to miss out on
    federal funding for energy efficiency in social housing due to a
    perceived lack of urgency in addressing this
    issue<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-nb-3">29</xref>. This highlights the
    need for continued efforts to improve energy efficiency in social
    housing, including promoting the adoption of rooftop solar.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, there is a need for greater awareness and education
    among homeowners about the benefits of energy efficiency and the
    available programs and incentives. Expanding outreach and education
    programs could encourage more homeowners to invest in
    energy-efficient upgrades and appliances.</p>
          <p>Overall, Queensland’s energy efficiency policies for residential
    housing demonstrate a positive trend towards a more sustainable
    energy future. Continued efforts in this area, with a focus on
    addressing gaps and improving existing measures, will be crucial in
    achieving long-term energy efficiency goals and reducing the state’s
    carbon footprint.</p>

          <p>Australia has demonstrated a commitment to improving energy
    efficiency, setting a national target of 40% improvement in energy
    productivity by 2030<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-4">1</xref>. This
    target is linked to broader climate and energy security goals, as
    energy efficiency measures can contribute to a more resilient energy
    system<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-4">2</xref>. While the country has
    made progress in energy savings since 2000 in the industrial and
    services sectors, primarily through efficiency disclosure regimes,
    labeling, and the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (GEMS) for
    appliances, improvement rates have slowed in recent
    years<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-4">3</xref>. To achieve its

            <bold>Research and Reports</bold>
          </title>
          <p>Several research papers and reports have examined energy
    efficiency in residential housing in the ACT and beyond. These
    studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of
    different policies and programs, as well as the challenges and
    opportunities for further improvement.</p>
          <p>One key area of research focuses on identifying effective Energy
    Efficiency Measures (EEMs) that can reduce energy consumption in
    homes. Studies have shown that measures such as insulation, heating
    and cooling upgrades, and efficient lighting can significantly
    reduce energy use and greenhouse gas
    emissions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-nb-5">24</xref>.</p>
          <p>Research has also explored the factors that influence the
    adoption of energy efficiency measures in households. Studies have
    identified barriers such as financial constraints, lack of
    awareness, and perceived complexity of
    upgrades<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-nb-5">25</xref>. Understanding
    these barriers and drivers is crucial for designing effective
    policies and programs that encourage energy efficiency upgrades.</p>
          <p>Another important area of research examines the impact of energy
    efficiency on rental properties. Studies have shown that
    energy-efficient features in rental properties can lead to higher
    rental prices, suggesting a positive economic impact for property
    owners<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-nb-5">26</xref>.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, research has highlighted the connection between
    energy efficiency and sustainable development
    goals<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-nb-5">27</xref>. Improving energy
    efficiency in residential housing contributes to broader
    sustainability goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
    improving air quality, and promoting resource conservation.</p>

          </title>
          <p>Industry reports and white papers provide further insights into
    energy efficiency in residential housing in the ACT. One concern
    raised by industry reports is the potential impact of stricter
    energy efficiency standards on housing
    affordability<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-nb-5">28</xref>. While
    acknowledging the benefits of energy efficiency, some stakeholders
    argue that stricter standards could increase construction costs and
    make housing less affordable, particularly for first-time buyers and
    low-income households.</p>
          <p>Industry stakeholders also emphasize the importance of market
    transformation strategies to encourage the adoption of
    energy-efficient technologies and
    practices<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-nb-5">29</xref>. Another key
    perspective from industry reports is the need for innovative
    financing mechanisms to support homeowners in making energy
    efficiency upgrades<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-nb-5">30</xref>.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, industry reports highlight the importance of
    considering the long-term cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency
    measures<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-nb-5">31</xref>. This includes
    evaluating the payback periods for different upgrades and
    considering factors such as energy prices, maintenance costs, and
    the lifespan of energy-efficient technologies.</p>

            <bold>Energy Efficiency Policies in Tasmania</bold>
          </title>
          <p>Tasmania faces a unique challenge: despite having relatively low
    electricity prices, Tasmanians experience high energy bills due to
    several factors, including the cool climate, older housing stock
    with poor thermal efficiency, and a reliance on inefficient electric
    appliances for heating<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-6">1</xref>. This
    paradox highlights the critical need for robust energy efficiency
    policies in the state.</p>
          <p>To address this challenge, Tasmania has implemented several
    policies aimed at improving energy efficiency in residential
    housing. These policies are driven by the need to reduce energy
    consumption, lower household energy bills, and mitigate the impact
    of climate change.</p>
          <p>One of the key policies is the <bold>Tasmanian Renewable Energy
    Target</bold>, which aims to increase the state’s renewable energy
    output by 200% based on 2022 figures by
    2040<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-6">2</xref>. This target is supported
    by the <bold>Tasmanian Renewable Energy Action Plan</bold>, which
    outlines the government’s vision and actions for achieving this
    goal<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-6">3</xref>.</p>
          <p>Recognizing the need to improve the energy efficiency of existing
    homes, the state government has committed $15 million in the
    2020/2021 Tasmanian Budget for public housing heating and energy
    efficiency initiatives<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-nb-6">4</xref>. This
    initiative aims to improve living conditions for public housing
    tenants while reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas
    emissions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-nb-6">5</xref>.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the government acknowledges the disparity in energy
    efficiency ratings between homeowners and tenants, particularly
    those who are financially
    vulnerable<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-nb-6">6</xref>. Policy measures
    are being explored to address this disparity and ensure equitable
    access to energy-efficient housing for all Tasmanians.</p>
          <p>The potential for energy efficiency policies to significantly
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions is also recognized. Studies indicate
    that implementing these policies could reduce emissions by 40.3
    million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2-e) by
    2050<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-nb-6">7</xref>.</p>

            <bold>Energy Efficiency Regulations in
    Tasmania</bold>
          </title>
          <p>Tasmania has adopted regulations to ensure that new homes and
    renovations meet energy efficiency standards. These regulations are
    primarily based on the National Construction Code (NCC) and the
    Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS).</p>
          <p>It is important to note that the average energy efficiency rating
    of existing homes in Australia is only 1.7 stars, while in Tasmania,
    it is 4 stars<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-nb-6">8</xref>. This highlights
    the need for continuous improvement in the energy efficiency of the
    existing housing stock.</p>
          <p>Since 2003, Tasmania has required mandatory energy efficiency
    measures for new housing<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-nb-6">9</xref>. In
    2009, a “5 Star” requirement under NatHERS was introduced, and this
    was further increased to a “6-Star” standard in
    2013<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-nb-6">10</xref>. This 6-star standard
    plays a crucial role in driving the construction of energy-efficient
    homes in Tasmania<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-nb-6">11</xref>.</p>

          <p>The Northern Territory faces unique challenges in ensuring energy
    efficiency due to its high household energy consumption, driven by
    extreme temperatures and the effects of climate
    change<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-8">1</xref>. Rising temperatures,
    less predictable rainfall patterns, and the increasing intensity of
    cyclones further emphasize the need for a sustainable and resilient
    energy system<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-8">2</xref>. This section
    outlines the key policies and regulations that govern energy
    efficiency in residential housing in the NT.</p>

              <bold>Renewable Energy Targets</bold>
            </title>
            <p>The Northern Territory Government has set a target of 50%
      renewable energy by 2030<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-8">3</xref>.
      This commitment is supported by various plans, strategies, and
      programs aimed at achieving a sustainable and affordable energy
      future for the Territory<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-nb-8">4</xref>.
      The government also participates in national energy reforms
      through the Energy National Cabinet Reform Committee, contributing
      to broader opportunities for the Territory and Australia,
      including the national hydrogen
      strategy<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-nb-8">5</xref>.</p>

            </title>
            <p>In alignment with the National Construction Code (NCC), new
      homes and modified homes requiring building permits in the NT must
      meet certain energy efficiency
      standards<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-nb-8">6</xref>. These standards
      are designed to:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
              <list-item>
                <p>Enhance the comfort of living spaces</p>

              </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>Specifically, houses must achieve a minimum 5-star energy
      rating, while apartments must achieve at least a 3.5-star
      rating<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-nb-8">8</xref>. A recent study has
      shown that despite meeting minimum energy efficiency design
      standards, predicted energy use for thermal comfort in new
      detached dwellings increased by 10.4% per dwelling and 5.6%
      nationally in 2022 compared to
      2018<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-nb-8">9</xref>. This trend can be
      attributed to several factors, including:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
              <list-item>
                <p><bold>Increasing floor areas:</bold> As new homes are built

              <list-item>
                <p><bold>Limitations of minimum standards:</bold> The minimum
          energy efficiency standards may not be sufficient to offset
          the impact of these other factors, highlighting the need for
          continuous improvement in building codes and standards.</p>

            </title>
            <p>Formerly known as the Household Energy Efficiency Scheme
      (HEES), Energy Ahead is a vital program designed to assist WA
      households in enhancing the energy efficiency of their
      homes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-9">1</xref>. Delivered in
      partnership with Energy Policy WA, state-owned electricity
      retailers Synergy and Horizon Power, and non-government
      organizations (NGOs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-nb-9">2</xref>, this
      program offers practical solutions and support to eligible
      households.</p>
            <p>WA was once a leader in hardship energy efficiency programs,
      but the program was cut in
      2012<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-nb-9">3</xref>. The reintroduction of
      a program with similar goals through Energy Ahead highlights a
      renewed focus on energy efficiency and its importance in
      addressing cost-of-living pressures and climate change. The
      collaborative approach involving NGOs, Synergy, Horizon Power, and
      Energy Policy WA ensures that the program can effectively identify
      and support households most in
      need<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-nb-9">4</xref>.</p>

            </title>
            <p>While not a scheme in itself, NatHERS plays a crucial role in
      promoting energy efficiency in Australian homes, including those
      in WA. NatHERS provides a star rating system (0 to 10 stars) that
      indicates the energy efficiency of a home, with higher ratings
      signifying better performance. This rating system helps homeowners
      and builders understand the energy performance of their homes and
      make informed decisions about design and construction to optimize
      energy efficiency.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, the average Australian household has an energy
      efficiency rating as low as 1.8 out of 10 on the NatHERS
      scale<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-nb-9">9</xref>. This finding has
      significant implications for WA’s residential sector, suggesting a

            <bold>Conclusion</bold>
          </title>
          <p>Western Australia is actively pursuing energy efficiency in the
    residential housing sector through a combination of schemes,
    regulations, and initiatives. Programs like Energy Ahead provide
    direct support to households, while regulations ensure the safety
    and efficiency of energy systems. The WA Climate Policy and Energy
    Transformation Strategy provide a framework for long-term
    improvements in energy efficiency, with a focus on reducing
    emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable energy future.</p>
          <p>While these efforts are commendable, the analysis reveals a need
    for a more holistic approach to energy efficiency in residential
    housing. Future policies should move beyond simply setting minimum
    standards and consider the overall energy use of households. This
    could involve incentivizing smaller dwelling sizes, promoting
    energy-conscious design and behavior, and strengthening energy
    efficiency requirements. By addressing these challenges and adopting
    a more comprehensive approach, WA can further enhance energy
    efficiency in the residential sector, contributing to both cost
    savings for households and a more sustainable energy future for the
    state.</p>
