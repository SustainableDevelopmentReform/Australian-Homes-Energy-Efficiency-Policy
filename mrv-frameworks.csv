Framework,Purpose,Scope,Uptake,Strengths,Weaknesses
UN CBD Indicators,Measures and monitors biodiversity,"Species populations, habitat extent, ecosystem health",High; used globally for biodiversity targets,Provides broad biodiversity indicators,May lack specificity for detailed ecosystem health assessments
IUCN Red List of Ecosystems,Assesses conservation status of ecosystems,Risk of ecosystem collapse,High; recognized globally,Standardized risk assessment for ecosystems,"Primarily focused on risk, not comprehensive health metrics"
Living Planet Index (LPI),Tracks changes in global vertebrate species populations,Population trends of vertebrate species,High; widely used by conservation organizations,Provides trends in biodiversity,"Limited to vertebrate species, not all biodiversity"
Natural Capital Protocol,"Identifies, measures, and values natural capital impacts","Ecosystems, biodiversity, ecosystem services",Widely accepted in corporate sector,Comprehensive business-oriented impact assessment,May lack detailed ecological metrics
Ecosystem Services Framework (ESF),Assesses and values ecosystem services,"Provisioning, regulating, cultural, supporting services",Gaining acceptance in policy-making,Integrates ecological and socio-economic aspects,Implementation can be complex and subjective
Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII),Measures the intactness of biodiversity in a region,Biodiversity at species level,Growing in conservation research,Effective for monitoring biodiversity changes,"Focused primarily on biodiversiy, not broader ecological health"
Accounting for Nature,Measures and reports on the condition of environmental assets,"Ecological health of natural resources (soils, vegetation, fauna)","Emerging; primarily in Australia, expanding globally",Standardised ecological health metrics; comprehensive assessment,Limited broader application until further refinement globally
