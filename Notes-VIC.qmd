### **Implementation Strategies**

#### **7-Star Energy Efficiency Standards**

In 2022, Victoria raised the minimum energy efficiency building standards for new homes from 6 to 7 stars[^notes-vic-4]. This change necessitates improvements in insulation, window glazing, and the use of energy-efficient appliances in new homes[^notes-vic-5]. The 7-star standard ensures that new homes are designed and built to minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. Notably, this shift towards higher energy efficiency standards has created a demand for new skills and occupations in the building sector, with professionals now required to design and implement these energy-efficient measures[^notes-vic-6].
